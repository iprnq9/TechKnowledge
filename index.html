            <div id="about-content-title">Who We Are</div>
            <div id="about-content-text">TechKnowledge was created in order to connect those that need electronics and those that need to get rid of electronics and various technologically related items. It was only a few years ago for us all when we wanted to learn more about something, be it Raspberry Pi, computers, Arduino, robotics, or whatever, but couldn't afford to buy them. There we were: wanting to learn about a subject, but were restricted by money. This is clearly an issue for many underprivileged tinkerers around the globe.

                <blockquote>Only 12.5% of E-Waste is recycled.</blockquote>

                More recently, we have accumulated too many electronics, computer parts, wires, resistors, and whatever else our parents let us store in their basement. More than anyone, we understand that these electronics are perfectly good in most cases and could still be used by someone with more time or passion than us. We, unlike most Americans, knew that discarding of electronics in the trash is hazardous and wasteful. However, we simply did not know what to do with our mountain of electronics; it had always seemed somewhat wasteful to recycle the beauty that was put into creating such intricut devices.

                <blockquote>85% of our E-Waste are sent to landfills and incinerators are mostly burned, and release harmful toxins in the air!</blockquote>

                These two problems, the need of and the need to get rid of, developed TechKnowledge's sole purpose: to connect these two parties. While there are sites that allow users to post items up for sale, many times old electronics don't have much monetary value and, thus, users are reluctant to post such items.


                With TechKnowledge, the desire to help change a person's life and education drives users to find a good home for their unused electronics. In addition, those needing electronics can find donors on the site by searching for types of electronics and seeing a person that is looking to give away devices.

                Connecting local users to encourage donations builds community, provides resources for learning, and gives hope to those affected.<br><br>
